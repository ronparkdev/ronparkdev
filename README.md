### **<span data-lucide="code">üíª</span> Creative Full-Stack Engineer with a Foundation-First Approach**
I thrive on creative challenges and exploring cutting-edge technologies, but I believe innovation requires rock-solid foundations. I build type-safe, scalable systems using code generators from OpenAPI specs and sometimes create unified FE/BE modules for seamless integration. My monorepo-first approach and full-stack expertise enable me to design BE interfaces optimized for FE needs while crafting FE experiences that maximize BE performance.

### **<span data-lucide="smartphone">üì±</span> Mobile-First, Platform-Agnostic Developer**
With deep roots in iOS and Android development since 2012, I bring native mobile thinking to every project. I don't just make websites responsive‚ÄîI create experiences that feel native on every device, understanding the unique constraints and opportunities of mobile platforms.

### **<span data-lucide="bot">ü§ñ</span> Automation Evangelist & Efficiency Expert**
I can't stand repetitive tasks and automate everything possible, leveraging AI to work smarter. When I see colleagues wasting time, I find ingenious solutions to their problems. While AI can make code work, I specialize in refactoring it to be efficient, secure, and maintainable‚Äîthat's where human expertise shines.
